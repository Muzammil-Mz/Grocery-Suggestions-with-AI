# Grocery-Suggestions-with-AI

Built an intelligent grocery suggestion app that uses Gemini API (Google's Generative AI) to provide context-aware and personalized grocery item recommendations based on user inputs like dietary preferences, cuisine type, budget, and meal plans.

✨ Key Features:

🍽️ Accepts natural language input (e.g., "I want to prepare a vegan dinner for 3 days")

🤖 Uses Gemini API to generate grocery lists tailored to the request

🛍️ Organizes suggestions by category: veggies, grains, spices, etc.

💡 Offers additional recipe suggestions or substitutions

🗂️ Saves previous requests for user reference

🌐 Clean, minimal frontend for easy user interaction

🔧 Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js / HTML + CSS (optional)

Backend: Node.js + Express

API Integration: Gemini Pro via Google AI

Storage (optional): MongoDB / Local JSON

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Designing clean user prompts for structured grocery data

Building intelligent assistants for real-world use cases

Enhancing user experience with AI-generated suggestions

🚀 Future Enhancements:

Login & saved preferences
